## Abstract

This study investigates the use of **speech-based methods** to predict **depression severity**, comparing the performance of **machine learning** and **deep learning models** using the **DAIC-WOZ dataset**. It evaluates the predictive accuracy of models trained on **OpenSMILE-extracted features**. These include **prosodic**, **formant**, and **spectral characteristics**, alongside **deep features** derived from **spectrograms**.

**Preprocessing techniques** such as **noise reduction** and **segmentation** ensure **data quality** and **consistency**. **Machine learning models**, particularly **XGBoost**, achieve superior performance with a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **2.93**. **Deep learning models**, including **EfficientNet** and **ResNet**, achieve RMSE values of **6.92** and **6.93**, respectively. However, these models show limited ability to predict **extreme scores**.

The **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture** developed in this study offers **broader prediction coverage**. Despite this, the model records a higher RMSE of **7.77**, highlighting challenges in capturing **complex spectrogram features**.

Analysing **prediction distributions** identifies the **strengths** of the models and areas requiring **improvement**, particularly in predicting **extreme PHQ-8 scores**.
